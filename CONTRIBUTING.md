# Contributing

Commits and pull requests to repositories within FINOS such as this one will only be accepted from those contributors with an active, executed Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA) with FINOS, or who are covered under an existing and active Corporate Contribution License Agreement (CCLA) executed with FINOS. Commits from individuals not covered under an ICLA or CCLA will be flagged and blocked by the [FINOS cla-bot tool](https://github.com/finos-fdx/cla-bot). Please note that some CCLAs require individuals/employees to be explicitly named on the CCLA.

Need an ICLA? Unsure if you are covered under an existing CCLA? Email help@finos.org
